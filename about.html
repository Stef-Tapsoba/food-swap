                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>At Food Swap, our mission is to create a more sustainable and equitable food system by 
                    facilitating the exchange of locally-sourced, home-grown, and artisanal food items among members 
                    of our community.
                </p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Food Swap was founded in 2015 by a group of food enthusiasts who wanted to find a way to share 
                    their surplus produce with others in their community. Since then, we have grown into a network 
                    of food exchangers across the country, united by our passion for good food and sustainable living.
                </p>
