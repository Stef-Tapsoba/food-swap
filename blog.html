                                I discovered Food Swap a few months ago. I didn't really pay attention to it at first, but then I started struggling with finding affordable food
                                with all the prices going up... I remembered that I could connect with people who have what I don't have and it literally saved my life!
                                I'm never running out of food thanks to this community. Thank you all for participating :).

                                I wanted to preface this by saying that I am so glad Food Swap exists. I'm a Drexel student and I find that Mario's Market seriously lacks
                                in diversity food wise. When a friend told me about this website I was like "this is it!". Can't even remember the last time
                                I went to Mario's. The only issue I have with Food Swap is that I can't see which pick up points have what I want :( but hey,
                                it's a good start!

                                One thing that's important to know is that you can never know which product will trigger you allergies or
                                nah. I think the Food Swap admins should allow donors to upload the full list of ingredients. Okay, that
                                might not be that easy...
